    <h1>DIY V<sub>REF</sub></h1>
    <hr>

    <p>
        Some applications require a reference voltage that isn't V<sub>CC</sub> or Gnd. For instance, a tristate line
        where the floating value is neither hi nor low.<br>
        One can always use an absolute reference device, which may work for some applications, but sometimes a relative
        reference voltage is required or the designer of a circuit doesn't have access to such a device.<br>
        When dealing with electronic circuits, there is usually already a fixed voltage source, V<sub>CC</sub>. All that
        remains is constructing a resistor divider and you get your V<sub>REF</sub>, such as the one below:
    </p>

    </figure>

    <p>
        The problem with this approach is it can be difficult to imagine its behavior and requires a node calculation
        for i<sub>O</sub>.<br>
        A much easier version to understand is if V<sub>REF</sub> could be modeled simply as a voltage source with
        non-zero impedance, like in the image below:
    </p>

    <h2>Derivation</h2>

    <p>
        So let's check if the two circuits above are equivalent by setting i<sub>O</sub> equal to i<sub>REF</sub>. If
        the resulting equation has a solution, then the two circuits are indeed equivalent.<br>
        <img class="equation" src="Vref-with-impedance/derive_1.png"><br>
        After some rearranging, we arrive at the following:<br>
        <span>
            (1)
            <img class="equation" src="Vref-with-impedance/derive_2.png">
        </span><br>
        In order for equation 1 to have a solution, the two terms containing V<sub>O</sub> must be equal, i.e.:<br>
        <span>
            (2)
            <img class="equation" src="Vref-with-impedance/derive_3.png">
        </span><br>
        We can thus solve for R<sub>REF</sub>, and find that it is simply the parallel combination of R<sub>A</sub> and
        R<sub>B</sub>:<br>
        <span>
            (3)
            <img class="equation" src="Vref-with-impedance/derive_4.png">
        </span><br>
        We got the equation for R<sub>REF</sub>, now we can find V<sub>REF</sub> with the remaining parts of equation
        1:<br>
        <img class="equation" src="Vref-with-impedance/derive_5.png"><br>
        <span>
            (4)
            <img class="equation" src="Vref-with-impedance/derive_6.png">
        </span><br>
        Okay, so we know how to calculate V<sub>REF</sub> and R<sub>REF</sub>, but usually we define those values and
        work backwards to determine R<sub>A</sub> and R<sub>B</sub>, so let's find those values now.
    </p>

    <h2>Construction</h2>

    <p>
        As mentioned before, we'll work backwards to derive the equations for R<sub>A</sub> and R<sub>B</sub>.<br>
        If we can solve equation 4 for the ratio of R<sub>A</sub> and R<sub>B</sub>, then we'll be able to substitute
        the one for the other (this will become important further down).<br>
        <img class="equation" src="Vref-with-impedance/derive_7.png"><br>
        <span>
            (5)
            <img class="equation" src="Vref-with-impedance/derive_8.png">
        </span><br>
        Using equation 5, we can define each resistor in terms of the other, solving for their inverses so we can
        substitute them in equation 2 more easily:<br>
        <span>
            (6)
            <img class="equation" src="Vref-with-impedance/derive_9.png">
        </span><br>
        <span>
            (7)
            <img class="equation" src="Vref-with-impedance/derive_10.png">
        </span><br>
        By solving for their inverses, we can easily substitute equations 6 and 7 into equation 2:<br>
        <img class="equation" src="Vref-with-impedance/derive_11.png"><br>
        <span>
            (8)
            <img class="equation" src="Vref-with-impedance/derive_12.png">
        </span><br>
        <img class="equation" src="Vref-with-impedance/derive_13.png"><br>
        <span>
            (9)
            <img class="equation" src="Vref-with-impedance/derive_14.png">
        </span><br>
        And there we go! We now have R<sub>A</sub> and R<sub>B</sub> in terms of V<sub>REF</sub>, R<sub>REF</sub>, and
        V<sub>CC</sub>.

    <h2>Concluding Remarks</h2>

    <p>
        Naturally, selecting resistors will limit you to certain values, so the best approach would be to define
        V<sub>REF</sub> and use equations 6 and 7 to find the best pair of resistors for your application.
        After calculating R<sub>REF</sub> with equation 3, you can switch to the equivalent model for any
        calculations or to just make thinking about the reference's behavior easier.
    </p>

    <p>
        This model assumes that V<sub>CC</sub> is constant, which is true in most cases. Otherwise, V<sub>REF</sub>
        would change with V<sub>CC</sub> as it is a relative reference voltage.
    </p>

    <p>
        Keep in mind that there is a current flowing through R<sub>A</sub> and R<sub>B</sub>, even if nothing is
        connected to V<sub>O</sub>! This device is intended to act as a high-impedance reference, and setting
        R<sub>A</sub> and R<sub>B</sub> too low can result in a large amount of waste current flowing though them.<br>
        The worst-case scenario is when V<sub>O</sub> is equal to V<sub>REF</sub>, in which case:<br>
        <span>
            (10)
            <img class="equation" src="Vref-with-impedance/i_waste.png">
        </span><br>
        It does, hoever, have an upper bound as seen in equation 10, so the higher your reference impedance, the less
        waste current there will be. If you need a reference voltage with low output impedance, use a buffer.
    </p>

    <p>
        Lastly, if you decide to use a potentiometer to create an adjustable V<sub>REF</sub>, just remember that the
        maximum impedance is at 50%, which will be 1/4 the potentiometer's resistance. As you turn the knob further to
        the side, the impedance will lower until it reaches zero at 0% and 100%.
